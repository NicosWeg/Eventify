# Project Name - Eventify - FROZEN

## Problem
People want to find out about the offline events, but it’s all scattered across Telegram channels. That can take some time and energy, which is not the best way.

## Solution
A web platform that collects events from Telegram and allows users to register via the official google form of organizers or registering via the website itself, which then users can set reminders. And to manage attendance.

## MVP Features
- User authentication (Email / Google)
- Event listing (scraped from Telegram)
- Event detail page
- Event registration
- User profile with registered events

## Non-Goals (Important)
- No chat system
- No payments
- No recommendations (yet)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js 
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Scraper: Python (Telethon)

## High-Level Architecture
(Insert diagram or description)

## Future Improvements
- Search
- Badges ( to make it gamified )
- Notifications
- Organizer accounts
